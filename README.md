- **Bonus Analysis:** Explore purchasing patterns of the top 5 highest spend orders.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory analysis and documentation

## 📊 Key Insights
